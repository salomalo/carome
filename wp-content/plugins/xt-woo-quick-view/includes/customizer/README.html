<p>Helper scripts for theme authors.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re starting a new theme based on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/_s">underscores</a>, we recommend you start using our fork from <a href="https://github.com/aristath/_s">https://github.com/aristath/_s</a> as it already includes both of the methods described below, and also has 2 example settings for typography.</p>

<h2 id="integratingxtkirkiinyourthemes">Integrating XTKirki in your themes</h2>

<p>If you want to use XTKirki in your themes, it is not recommended to include the plugin files in your theme.
By recommending your users install XTKirki as a plugin they can get bugfixes easier and faster.
A lot of themes use TGMPA to recommend installing plugins, but if you only require XTKirki then using TGMPA might be an overkill.
In that case, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/aristath/xtkirki-helpers/blob/master/include-xtkirki.php">include-xtkirki.php</a> file to recommend the installation of XTKirki.</p>

<p>When the user visits the customizer, if they donâ€™t have XTKirki installed they will see a button prompting them to install it.
You can configure the description in that file and make sure you change the textdomain in that file from <code>textdomain</code> to the actual textdomain your theme uses.</p>

<h3 id="usage:">Usage:</h3>

<p>In your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file add the following line, changing <code>'/inc/include-xtkirki.php'</code> to the path where the file is located:</p>

<pre><code class="php">require_once get_template_directory() . '/inc/include-xtkirki.php';
</code></pre>

<h2 id="makingsurethatoutputworkswhenxtkirkiisnotinstalled">Making sure that <code>output</code> works when XTKirki is not installed</h2>

<p>If you use the <code>output</code> argument in your fields, XTKirki will automatically generate the CSS needed for your theme, as well as any Google-Fonts scripts.
In order to make sure that user styles will continue to work even if they uninstall the XTKirki plugin, you can include the <a href="https://github.com/aristath/xtkirki-helpers/blob/master/class-my-theme-xtkirki.php"><code>class-my-theme-xtkirki</code></a> file.</p>

<h3 id="usage:">Usage:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rename the file to use the actual name of your theme.
 Example: <code>twentysixteen-xtkirki.php</code>.</li>
<li>Inside the file, search for <code>My_Theme_XTKirki</code> and replace it using your theme-name as a prefix.
 Example: <code>Twentysixteen_XTKirki</code>.</li>
<li>In your theme&#8217;s <code>functions.php</code> file add the following line, changing <code>'/inc/class-my-theme-xtkirki'</code> to the path where the file is located:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="php">require_once get_template_directory() . '/inc/class-my-theme-xtkirki.php';
</code></pre>

<p>Once you do the above, instead of using <code>XTKirki</code> to add your config, panels, sections &amp; fields as documented in the <a href="https://xtkirki.org">XTKirki Documentation</a> examples, you will have to use your own class.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<h4 id="good:">Good:</h4>

<pre><code class="php">Twentysixteen_XTKirki::add_config( 'my_theme', array(
    'capability'    =&gt; 'edit_theme_options',
    'option_type'   =&gt; 'theme_mod',
) );
</code></pre>

<h4 id="bad:">Bad:</h4>

<pre><code class="php">XTKirki::add_config( 'my_theme', array(
    'capability'    =&gt; 'edit_theme_options',
    'option_type'   =&gt; 'theme_mod',
) );
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Twentysixteen_XTKirki</code> class will act as a proxy to the <code>XTKirki</code> class.
If the XTKirki plugin is installed, then it will be used to add your panels, sections, fields etc.
However if the plugin is not installed, the <code>Twentysixteen_XTKirki</code> will make sure that all your CSS and google-fonts will still work.</p>
